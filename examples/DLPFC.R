## grid ----

# Lattice type
type = "hexagonal"

# Why an hexagonal grid?
# https://strimas.com/post/hexagonal-grids/

# Regular hexagons are the closest shape to a circle that can be used for the
# regular tessellation of a plane and they have additional symmetries compared 
# to squares. These properties give rise to the following benefits.

# - Reduced edge effects: a hexagonal grid gives the lowest perimeter to area 
#   ratio of any regular tessellation of the plane. In practice, this means that 
#   edge effects are minimized when working with hexagonal grids. This is 
#   essentially the same reason beehives are built from hexagonal honeycomb: it 
#   is the arrangement that minimizes the amount of material used to create a 
#   lattice of cells with a given volume.
# - All neighbours are identical: square grids have two classes of neighbours, 
#   those in the cardinal directions that share an edge and those in diagonal 
#   directions that share a vertex. In contrast, a hexagonal grid cell has six 
#   identical neighbouring cells, each sharing one of the six equal length 
#   sides. Furthermore, the distance between centroids is the same for all 
#   neighbours.
# - Better fit to curved surfaces: when dealing with large areas, where the 
#   curvature of the earth becomes important, hexagons are better able to fit 
#   this curvature than squares. This is why soccer balls are constructed of 
#   hexagonal panels.
# - They look badass: it canâ€™t be denied that hexagonal grids look way more 
#   impressive than square grids!

# Step of the grid
h <- 6.4
# It is decided by the user by looking at the initial distribution of location. 
# Lower the value of h more precise will be the domain reconstruction.
# However, it can not be too low otherwise there could be unwelcome holes in 
# the domain

# Seed Point
seed_point <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x = 235, y = -126), coords = c("x", "y"))
# It is the seed for the generation of the grid, the final grid is guaranteed to
# contain this point. It is used to have always the same grid.
